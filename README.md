**ALL ABOUT ITALIAN PASTA**
Italian pasta (pronounced “PAS-tah”) is a collective name for a category of food made from wheat flour and water, sometimes with egg. The name refers to the resulting dough (pasta also means “dough”) that is rolled out and cut into various shapes.

Pasta is cooked in water and served with a sauce. All in all, pasta is one of the most famous, most eaten and certainly the most loved dishes in the world.


- There are more than three hundred different types of pasta. The most popular forms are:
* Spaghetti: thin round long strings
* Lasagne: wide, flat sheets
* Macaroni: short, narrow, curved tubes
* Papardelle: flat, fairly wide ribbons
* Penne: short tubes
* Ravioli: dough cushions with a filling
* Tagliatelle: flat, fairly narrow ribbons
 
- Examples of known pasta-with-sauce combinations are:
* Lasagne bolognese: pasta sheets with a tomato-meat sauce baked in the oven
* Spaghetti alla carbonara: spaghetti with bacon and a cream sauce
* Spaghetti alle vongole: spaghetti with shellfish

 The matching of pasta with sauce is a true art that Italians are introduced from an early age. Most of us are completely satisfied with a plate of “pasta with pesto” and serve it with whatever pasta we have in the cupboard.

An Italian mother would never just use any pasta form with her authentic pesto Genovese. Types of pasta that go with pesto include linguine, penne or trenette (a variant of tagliatelle).

Another “wrong” combination that Italians abhor but the rest of the world loves? Spaghetti bolognese. Italians think that thin, delicate pasta strings should be served with a relatively light sauce or thin cream sauce rather than a robust ragu. 

Just like bread and noodles, pasta is also an important food category that people have been feeding on for centuries, probably since ancient times. The first description of pasta dates from 1279. It refers to macaroni, although they did not necessarily mean small tubes. About a hundred years later, gnocchi is described in the Decameron. Also in the fourteenth century, Italian letters talk about ravioli filled with pork, cheese and parsley. It’s clear that, in the Middle Ages, people liked to eat pasta!

Pasta has also been eaten outside Italy for centuries. The British have been eating macaroni with cheese since the Middle Ages and have added vermicelli to their soup since the seventeenth century. The American president, Thomas Jefferson, was also a fan – in the eighteenth century, he was very fond of ‘macaroni’ and even had a pasta machine shipped from Italy to America.

**DID YOU KNOW**
Before the Second World War, pasta was not called pasta at all. Until recently, the word “pasta” was used in Italy for all types of dough – what is now pasta was called “paste alimentari.” In most other countries, it was known as noodles or macaroni. In Germany, pasta is still called ‘nudeln’ which derives from noodles.
